# Description
This program partly presents the processing performed by Ladybird, a tool for automatic detection of fast-ripples (FRs) in epilepsy.

The objective is to allow users to understand the deep-learning component of our detection procedure, which is a major step. User can use his own data or use the data we provide on this page.

The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to recognise scalograms of 400 ms portions of EEG activity containing or not containing an FR. It can be adapted to macro-EEG or micro-EEG data (see https://ladybird-brainsoft.webnode.fr/data-sharing/ for further explanation).

The user provides a 400 ms time series and the sampling rate as input. The algorithm will perform the following steps:

- Standardize the raw signal
- Pre-whiten the standardized raw signal [ref. 1],
- Generate the continuous wavelet scalogram (CWT, [ref. 2]),
- Whiten the scalogram (ZH0 normalization, see [ref. 3, ref. 4]),
- Apply a two-dimensional convolution to the whitened scalogram (see an example from a previous study on epileptic spikes in ref. 5).
- Submit the final scalogram (50x500 pixels) to the CNN for classification as FR or nonFR.

# Some information about the dataset
Data were recorded from drug-resistant epilepsy patients implanted with deep intracerebral hybrid electrodes (see Figure 1). They are anonymised and represent only a small fraction of the available records. Each selected event was reviewed by at least two users: a neurologist (J. Curot, MD, PhD) and a neuroscientist (L.Gardy, PhD or E. Despouy, PhD. Also with E.J. Barbeau, PhD and C. Hurter, PhD).

We also propose some simulated data to validate our procedure with a known frequency, duration and position. The provided database is structured as shown in Figure 2.

# Normalization process
Before feeding the CNN, EEG raw data and scalograms are normalized through different methods. Figure 3 shows an example of this process. On this figure, the y axis of scalograms are represtend between 10 and 600 Hz.
